 The global twenty first centurary pandemic covid 19 ,first case was reported in the month of december 2019  in Wuhan, China.<br>
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).<br>
It is one of the deadliest pandemic next to bubonic plague.One of the pecicular fact about such pandemics ,is that they don't last more than <br> two years,
but numerous scientist and memebers of WHO(World Health Organization) have predicated that, this drastic pandemic may last <br> till 2023.

<font size ='6' face ='Timesnew roman' color='white'>Mode of Transmission:</font>
<p> <font size ='4' face ='Timesnew roman' color='white'>
The virus is transmitted through direct contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person (generated through coughing and sneezing),<br> and  inhaling  the virus surfaces  from contaminated with . 
The COVID-19 virus may survive on surfaces for several hours, but simple <br> disinfectants can kill it.

<font size ='6' face ='Timesnew roman' color='white'> Covid strains : </font>
<p> <font size ='4'face ='Timesnew roman'color='white'>
The covid variants are arised due to collection of mutations.In genral viruses replicate by copying their genome,but all copies are perfect,
each <br> of these imperfect copies are hence known mutation or different variant from the original or parent strain. In most of the cases the mutation,<br>
doesn't change the virus behaviour and make it less successful than the original strain.But in  few rare cases the mutation becomes benefical and <br>
successful for this strain than its original or parent strain , i.e they can become more infectious or can able to avoid the defence immune system of <br>
the host body.All these mutations enhance the spike protein of the virus to penerate into the human cells. 
<br>
<br>
The more virus replicates and spreads at exponential rate , there is high posssibility of mutation which in case occurs  in human population.

These above mentioned strains have high transmissibility and more contagious.Recent studies and experiments suggest that the most of the mutations develope
<br> resistance 
towards vaccine ,thus the vaccines are partially effective .Now the Mu variant shows complete resistance towards vaccines,it is the fifth variant of the virus.
<br>This virus has been spreading all across Europe ,USA,UK,Hong-Kong.

The <B>B.1.1.529 </B>variant was first reported to WHO from South Africa on 24 November 2021. The epidemiological situation 
<br>in South Africa has been characterized by three distinct peaks in reported cases, the latest of which was predominantly 
<br>the Delta variant. In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant.
<br> The first known confirmed <B> B.1.1.529 </B>infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.
<br>
<br>

This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning.While the other variants consist of up to 13
<br> mutations in their genomes but this one has over 50 mutations in it.Thus the current vaccines are 40% ineffective 
<br>against them Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant,as compared to 
<br>other <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_compound'> <font color ='pink'>VOCs</a></font>. 
The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa.
<br>
<br>
current SARS-CoV-2 PCR diagnostics continue to detect this variant. Several labs have indicated that for one widely 
<br>used PCR test, one of the three target genes is not detected <B> (called S gene dropout or S gene target failure)</B>
<br> and this test can therefore be used as marker for this variant, pending sequencing confirmation. 
<br>Using this approach, this variant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection, 
<br>suggesting that this variant may have a growth advantage.

<font size ='6' face ='Timesnew roman' color='white'> Conclusion:</font>
<p> <font size ='4' face ='Timesnew roman' color='white'>
As long the virus spreads it makes copies of itself with more variants.So if we need to stop the variants, we need to stop the virus.
<br>The virus has evolved
but it hasn't morphed into something unrecognizable.The vaccines still have effects on these variants ,
<br>the problem is the vaccines aren't reaching the 
world's population soon enough.Which is only giving the virus more time to change <br>and ravage the areas of the world that are still waiting.The rise of 
the variants is an indicator or reminder to the world that the pandemic isn't over!...
